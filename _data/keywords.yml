# this is just like a book's index
# each item is a rule for how to link words in your document to where a reader can find more information

# each item has a dash and some fields
# indentation is important
# the dash should be all the way to the left
# the fields should be lined up 2 spaces (or a tab) from the left

# name
  # this is the string the website searches your pages for
# (optional) url
  # this is the link to a page when a user clicks the 'name' on a page
  # if there is no 'url', it means 'do not link' and any matching text will not be included in later matches
# (optional) scope
  # only apply the rule to pages which contain the scope
  # defaults to '/'

# exclude items with no url attribute
